# Divergences_of_darkness-Multiplayer-PUIR
A Victoria 2 DoD Submod based on Igor PUIR's economy, with a few more edits.

The goal is to have DoD's immense flavor, combined with Igor PUIR's stable and flexible economy for an optimal playing experience.

The mod itself is a merge between DoD Multiplayer 1.9 and Igor PUIR (whatever version Reno has it up to right now)

Current Checksum is SIEM
