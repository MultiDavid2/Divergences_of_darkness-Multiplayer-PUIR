# Divergences_of_darkness-Multiplayer-PUIR
A Victoria 2 DoD Submod based on Igor PUIR's economy, with a few more edits.

The goal is to have DoD's immense flavor, combined with Igor PUIR's stable and flexible economy for an optimal playing experience.

The mod itself is a merge between DoD Multiplayer 1.9 and Igor PUIR (whatever version Reno has it up to right now) and contains a great deal of changes to DoD to try to make it more enjoyable and balanced.

I am not the best at organizing a global list of changes, but some of them, as of now, are:

-An attempt at a functional Beornia.

-RGO Changes to make certain nations more viable (PLC and Ameriga)

-RGO Decisions to aid a Civilized Indian Nation (viable Mughals, or whatever other Indian country takes over)

-Removal of the Dual Monarchy's decisions to core Burgundian lands. (less railroaded war between the two)

-State Changes, consolidating some useless states into bigger ones to aid with National Focus efficiency.

-A LOT of life-rating changes, from setting the whole of the Americas to 37 life-rating, to giving each country's capital 40 life-rating, un-fucking vanilla life-ratings in Germany and France (regions), etc.

-A brand-new improvement to the Grants system implemented in most Multiplayer mods, in DoDPUIR you can, as a sphereling, ask your spherelord for a grant which will be paid every month.

-Removal of Pomeranian culture, and a return to Elbian for Scandinavia.

-PUIR's China balance, so the chinese nations can be played regularly in MP sessions without causing any harm to the economy or the game's balance.

-Halved Factories (credit to VRRP), where each factory is half of what a regular vanilla one is, be it in cost, output, build time, employer slots, etc. In order to grant much better flexibility in factory-building and making it easier on countries which start to industrialize early into the game.

And a fair bit of other minor and major changes which you'll be able to find on the Changelog.

Current Checksum is YJFT
