Changelog for PUIR DoD v1

All Pop needs have been replaced with PUIR pop needs, Serfs got some changes to try to match up with PUIR Ratios.

Serf Needs Changes (to roughly match PUIR's ratios, I am working with the assumption that Serf needs are a hybrid between farmer and labourer needs (as they resemble it)): 
-25% Life Need for Cattle (1 to 0.75/day)
-30% Everyday Need for Fertilizer (0.5 to 0.35)
+40% Everyday Need for Explosive (0.25 to 0.35)
+50% Luxury Need for Regular Clothes (2 to 3)
Removed Luxury Need for Wine (1 to 0)
-85% Luxury Need for Coffee (3 to 0.45)
-69% Luxury Need for Tobacco (3 to 0.95)
Added Luxury Need for Explosives (0.35)
Added Luxury Need for Fertilizer (0.35)

Ditched DoD's National Foci for PUIR's

Removed all the Healthcare reform bonuses (at max level, healthcare only grants you 0.02% pop growth, this is WIP as I will be copying the way Victoria Universalis handles Healthcare in a later update)

All the below nations have been given scripted goldmines if they are players:
-Muscovy
-DualMonarchy
-Spain
-Burgundy
-Bohemia
-Austria
-Bavaria
-Savoy
-Venice
-Etruria
-Hungary
-Polish-Lithuanian Commonwealth
-Ottoman Empire
-Muscovy
-Egypt
-Ethiopia
-Leeuwin
-Iraq
-Teheran
-Qing Empire
-Plantagenia
-Belgian Confederacy
-Vinland
-Tawantinsuyu
-Amazonie
-Lotharingia

(More will be added later, but seeing as this is V1 and I'm not even sure if this is worth the hassle, this is what you'll get)

Added an event which automaticly gives the inherent immigration bonus from PUIR/vanilla to newly civilized nations in the Americas, or Australia/New Zealand (the Maori nation, the Incas, and the Rhonst, that nation between Arcadia and QingQiu, this also makes Zhourao a proper immigrant nation, even though the liferatings haven't been changed to support this)

Added an event which automaticly grants Uncivilized Nations techs based on their starting reforms (bugfix from PUIR's unciv reforms)

Anything else that was changed, economy-wise, assume to be the same as Igor PUIR's (Reno).

Bugfixes: 

-Made it so the "RGO Spawn Events" (stuff such as Oil, Precious Metals, Rubber) only apply once. (if you tried to replace an event-gold mine via the RGO Change decision, the province would flip back immediately to gold)
