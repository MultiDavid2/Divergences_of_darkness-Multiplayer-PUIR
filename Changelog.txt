Changelog for PUIR DoD v1

All Pop needs have been replaced with PUIR pop needs, Serfs got some changes to try to match up with PUIR Ratios.

Serf Needs Changes (to roughly match PUIR's ratios, I am working with the assumption that Serf needs are a hybrid between farmer and labourer needs (as they resemble it)): 
-25% Life Need for Cattle (1 to 0.75/day)
-30% Everyday Need for Fertilizer (0.5 to 0.35)
+40% Everyday Need for Explosive (0.25 to 0.35)
+50% Luxury Need for Regular Clothes (2 to 3)
Removed Luxury Need for Wine (1 to 0)
-85% Luxury Need for Coffee (3 to 0.45)
-69% Luxury Need for Tobacco (3 to 0.95)
Added Luxury Need for Explosives (0.35)
Added Luxury Need for Fertilizer (0.35)

Ditched DoD's National Foci for PUIR's

Removed all the Healthcare reform bonuses (at max level, healthcare only grants you 0.02% pop growth, this is WIP as I will be copying the way Victoria Universalis handles Healthcare in a later update)

All the below nations have been given scripted goldmines if they are players:
-Muscovy
-DualMonarchy
-Spain
-Burgundy
-Bohemia
-Austria
-Bavaria
-Savoy
-Venice
-Etruria
-Hungary
-Polish-Lithuanian Commonwealth
-Ottoman Empire
-Muscovy
-Egypt
-Ethiopia
-Leeuwin
-Iraq
-Teheran
-Qing Empire
-Plantagenia
-Belgian Confederacy
-Vinland
-Tawantinsuyu
-Amazonie
-Lotharingia

(More will be added later, but seeing as this is V1 and I'm not even sure if this is worth the hassle, this is what you'll get)

Added an event which automaticly gives the inherent immigration bonus from PUIR/vanilla to newly civilized nations in the Americas, or Australia/New Zealand (the Maori nation, the Incas, and the Rhonst, that nation between Arcadia and QingQiu, this also makes Zhourao a proper immigrant nation, even though the liferatings haven't been changed to support this)

Added an event which automaticly grants Uncivilized Nations techs based on their starting reforms (bugfix from PUIR's unciv reforms)

Anything else that was changed, economy-wise, assume to be the same as Igor PUIR's (Reno).

###Geopolitical Changes### (Terrain, Decisions, everything related to the countries which might alter the way players play their country)

-Removed Dual Monarchy's two decisions which, after conquest, grant it cores on two of Burgundy's states (Pas-de-Calais and Bourgogne)

Bugfixes: 

-Made it so the "RGO Spawn Events" (stuff such as Oil, Precious Metals, Rubber) only apply once. (if you tried to replace an event-gold mine via the RGO Change decision, the province would flip back immediately to gold)


IF YOU FIND ANY BUGS, ISSUES AND OR CRASHES, REPORT THEM TO MULTIDAVID

------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

v1.2

-Fixed the "John Cena" event.

------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

v2.0 - Liferatings

-Fixed life-rating in Natal (Lusitania, prov 138).
-Fixed Temuco (Incas, prov 2329) not being colonial.
-Removed all of Austria's Vanilla Decisions (Austria-Hungary, and the Architecture thingy)

###Geopolitical Changes###

#North America, South America, Australia:
-Made every province that I could in North, South America AND in Austrialia/New Zealand at least 37 Life-Rating. (the ones that do not have this change, are the crappy canadian provinces at the top of America).
-Made as many provinces I could find with more than 40 life-rating, go down to 40 life-rating, since there was no difference from 40 or 40+ life-rating, this has no actual effect in-game.
-Altered every decision, and event (that I could find), which changed Life-Ratings to function with the altered life-ratings from the above changes. (means you won't see 40+ life-rating provinces when this is meaningless, all events and decisions now make the provinces they target, at most, 40 life-rating)

#Burgundy, Germany, Savoy:
-Made all provinces which are cores of the German Empire have 40 life-rating. (The austrian bits of Germany kept the old life-rating from vanilla of 35, this also includes DoD Switzerland)
-Made all core provinces of Burgundy, which are not German, have 35 life-rating. (Burgundy holds French, German and Swiss provinces, of which they had their own different life-ratings due to balance, perhaps from HFM, or Vanilla. I kept the Germans (with the exception of Alsace) at 40 life-rating, and made everything else 35 life-rating to keep it uniform)
-Made all provinces in the region of Savoy (which is shared by Burgundy and Savoy) have 35 life-rating (yet again making life-ratings uniform and removing the unnecessary vanilla nerfs that were kept by DoD)


A good bit of DoD's American, be it North or South, provinces were less than 35 life-rating (the default on most provinces), a lot of them even being below 30 life-rating (when you get population to actually grow). I have changed them all to be at least 37 life-rating, you should see a TREMENDOUS boost in natural population growth in the Americas, and a drastic increase in relevance in provinces with great RGOs that had shit life-rating (looking at you Qingqu, Incas).
Including Austrialia/New Zealand in the life-rating changes is part of my attempt to add Zhourao as an Immigrant nation, a nation you can actually play and might have an impact in the world.

The German/Burgundian changes are massive, Burgundy inherited a lot of bad life-rating provinces it had no business getting from Vanilla/HFM, and German high-liferating now properly includes the Austrians and the Swiss. I did however, keep this massive buff away from Bohemia, as I had explained before, as I feel their position in the world stage is too strong, and they are either incredibly powerful or immediately partitioned.

v2.1 

-Fixed the event which grants uncivs their techs at the start of the game.

------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

v3.0 Polish-Lithuanian Ironwealth, Romanians in Hungary 

#PLC Changes
-Made Krakow 35 life-rating down from 40 (PLC's capital is in Warsaw)
-Made Rostov (110k Coal province) now produce Iron instead of Coal, in an attempt to aid PLC in it's Iron Shortage.
-Added a decision to drain the Ruthenian Marshes, this will increase the life-rating of Slutsk, Mozyr and Korosten from 15 to 40, and add a Modifier to them which negates the Marsh Terrain Maluses, and even adds +20% Farming Efficiency.
This decision makes those provinces more useful in general, and is acquired once you've unlocked Steam Turbine, Pneumatics and Hydraulics, and have 100k to waste
NOTE: This decision can be taken by ANYONE who owns all 3 provinces.

#Crimea Changes (mostly PLC-Muscovy Changes)
-Exchanged one Coal province in the left-most state to Iron, making it a Coal/Iron state.
-Exchanged one Coal province in the right-most state to Iron, making it also a Coal/Iron state.
The two above changes mean that the whole of Crimea, all 3 states, are now Coal/Iron states, making them that much more valuable to both the PLC and Muscovy.

#Hungary Changes
-Gave Hungary a decision to integrate all the romanian minors, gain Romanian as Accepted AND remove both Siebenburger and Romanian cores from their provinces (this does allow Wallachia and Moldavia to be released again), if Hungary has unlocked Revolution and CounterRevolution, and owns all Romanian Core States.
There was only one nation in the game that accepted Romanian, and that was Romania, which might or might not form. As such, Hungary has now been given a chance to supplant Romania as the country which accepts Romanians, and if executed, gives Hungary a fat power boost for the mid and late game.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

v4.0 State Consolidation, Dagestani/Bosniak rights, Life-rating bugfixes and changes

#State Changes
-Took Salzburg from the Bavaria state and put it in the Tyrol state. (small pop boost to the Tyrol state)
-Consolidated Liguria into Piedmont (clean-up on the italian border)
-Consolidated Memel into Lietuva (Lithuania is a single state, pop boost to the overall state)
-Consolidated Western Finland into Southern Finland (2 random provinces in a different state, not anymore)
-Consolidated Naryan-Mara into Arkhangelsk (low-pop, no strategic value state unification)
-Consolidated Thessalia into Central Greece (might be meaningful strategically, consolidates greek pops into a bigger state)
-Consolidated Manzandaran into Irakajemi and Khorasan (meaningless state)
-Consolidated a few small russian siberian states into the "Sibir" State (forgot the name, meaningless strategic value so best to have a bigger state)
-Consolidated Luxembourg into Wallonie (this is now a very, VERY good state, strategic value remains the same)
-Consolidated Constantinople into Eastern Thrace and Bithnynia (constatinople was a 2-province state, and with too much of a strategic value, splitting it up is easier on National Focuses and makes it less of a liability if taken)

#Life-rating Changes
-Fixed the Northern Hokkaido provinces having 10 life-rating instead of 35
-Lowered Cairo from 45 life-rating to 40. (doesn't change pop growth)

Capital life-rating changes: (a lot of countries's capitals weren't 40 life-rating, and a few old capitals were, fixed a bunch of these and added a few "releaseable" nations's capital bonuses)
-Edo 40-35 | Tokyo 35-40
-Edinburgh 35-40
-Dublin 35-40
-Barcelona 35-40
-Sevastopol 35-40
-Amazonie Capital 35-40 (forgot name)
-Copenhagen 35-40 | Stockholm 40-35 | Christiania 40-35
-Helsinki 35-40
-Qingquo Capital 35-40 (forgot name)
-MexicoCity 35-40
-Burgundy Capital 35-40 (forgot name)
-Athens 35-40

#Accepted Culture Changes
-Gave Illyria Bosniak as Accepted Culture
-Gave all iterations of Transcaucasia, and the Safavids, Dagestani Accepted

v4.1 Spherelord-to-Sphereling Monthly Grants, Return to DoD Military

#Goods/Factory Changes
-Fixed Capitalist-produced Canned Goods requiring Iron instead of Wool, made that Wool input be 2.3 instead of the factory's 1.8.
-Reduced Fish requirement for Canned Goods Factories from 2.5 to 2.
-Made it so Canned Goods Factories gain a 5% state bonus from Wool instead of Iron.

#Grant Changes
-Added Spherelord-to-Sphereling Monthly Grants, these Grants allow Spherelings to ask their Spherelord for a certain amount of cash every month.

#Military Changes
-Ditched PUIR's military system, went back to DoD 1.9 MP's.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

v4.2 Amerigan Coal and Iron, The Return of Beornia, African Life-Rating

#RGO Changes
-Added two Iron provinces to Amazonie (11k pop, Semi-Desert - 3k pop, Grassland)
-Added two Iron, and two Coal provinces to Lotharingia (16k pop, Grassland - 33k pop, Hills) (28k pop, Forest - 23k pop, Grassland)
-Added a Coal province in southern Gran Colombia (Venezuela) (23k pop, Grassland)
-Added two Coal provinces in southern, unciv, Beornia (1k pop, Steppe)

#POP Changes
-Quadrupled Beornia's pop to 950k (intended to make them more self-sufficient, less reliant on immigration, also increases the total pop of Ameriga, the formable, to 3 million, similar to 1836 Arcadia)

#Life-rating Changes
-Every African province that is someone's core (vast majority), isn't a Desert, and isn't 35 life-rating or above, has been set to 35 life-rating. (This fixes a lot of DoD problems with colonial provinces which have 1, 10, 15, 20 liferating unnecessarily)
