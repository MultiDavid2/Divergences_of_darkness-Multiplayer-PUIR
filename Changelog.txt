Changelog for PUIR DoD v1

All Pop needs have been replaced with PUIR pop needs, Serfs got some changes to try to match up with PUIR Ratios.

Serf Needs Changes (to roughly match PUIR's ratios, I am working with the assumption that Serf needs are a hybrid between farmer and labourer needs (as they resemble it)): 
-25% Life Need for Cattle (1 to 0.75/day)
-30% Everyday Need for Fertilizer (0.5 to 0.35)
+40% Everyday Need for Explosive (0.25 to 0.35)
+50% Luxury Need for Regular Clothes (2 to 3)
Removed Luxury Need for Wine (1 to 0)
-85% Luxury Need for Coffee (3 to 0.45)
-69% Luxury Need for Tobacco (3 to 0.95)
Added Luxury Need for Explosives (0.35)
Added Luxury Need for Fertilizer (0.35)

Ditched DoD's National Foci for PUIR's

Removed all the Healthcare reform bonuses (at max level, healthcare only grants you 0.02% pop growth, this is WIP as I will be copying the way Victoria Universalis handles Healthcare in a later update)

All the below nations have been given scripted goldmines if they are players:
-Muscovy
-DualMonarchy
-Spain
-Burgundy
-Bohemia
-Austria
-Bavaria
-Savoy
-Venice
-Etruria
-Hungary
-Polish-Lithuanian Commonwealth
-Ottoman Empire
-Muscovy
-Egypt
-Ethiopia
-Leeuwin
-Iraq
-Teheran
-Qing Empire
-Plantagenia
-Belgian Confederacy
-Vinland
-Tawantinsuyu
-Amazonie
-Lotharingia

(More will be added later, but seeing as this is V1 and I'm not even sure if this is worth the hassle, this is what you'll get)

Added an event which automaticly gives the inherent immigration bonus from PUIR/vanilla to newly civilized nations in the Americas, or Australia/New Zealand (the Maori nation, the Incas, and the Rhonst, that nation between Arcadia and QingQiu, this also makes Zhourao a proper immigrant nation, even though the liferatings haven't been changed to support this)

Added an event which automaticly grants Uncivilized Nations techs based on their starting reforms (bugfix from PUIR's unciv reforms)

Anything else that was changed, economy-wise, assume to be the same as Igor PUIR's (Reno).

###Geopolitical Changes### (Terrain, Decisions, everything related to the countries which might alter the way players play their country)

-Removed Dual Monarchy's two decisions which, after conquest, grant it cores on two of Burgundy's states (Pas-de-Calais and Bourgogne)

Bugfixes: 

-Made it so the "RGO Spawn Events" (stuff such as Oil, Precious Metals, Rubber) only apply once. (if you tried to replace an event-gold mine via the RGO Change decision, the province would flip back immediately to gold)

v1.2

-Fixed the "John Cena" event.

------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

v2.0 - Liferatings

-Fixed life-rating in Natal (Lusitania, prov 138).
-Fixed Temuco (Incas, prov 2329) not being colonial.
-Removed all of Austria's Vanilla Decisions (Austria-Hungary, and the Architecture thingy)

###Geopolitical Changes###

#North America, South America, Australia:
-Made every province that I could in North, South America AND in Austrialia/New Zealand at least 37 Life-Rating. (the ones that do not have this change, are the crappy canadian provinces at the top of America).
-Made as many provinces I could find with more than 40 life-rating, go down to 40 life-rating, since there was no difference from 40 or 40+ life-rating, this has no actual effect in-game.
-Altered every decision, and event (that I could find), which changed Life-Ratings to function with the altered life-ratings from the above changes. (means you won't see 40+ life-rating provinces when this is meaningless, all events and decisions now make the provinces they target, at most, 40 life-rating)

#Burgundy, Germany, Savoy:
-Made all provinces which are cores of the German Empire have 40 life-rating. (The austrian bits of Germany kept the old life-rating from vanilla of 35, this also includes DoD Switzerland)
-Made all core provinces of Burgundy, which are not German, have 35 life-rating. (Burgundy holds French, German and Swiss provinces, of which they had their own different life-ratings due to balance, perhaps from HFM, or Vanilla. I kept the Germans (with the exception of Alsace) at 40 life-rating, and made everything else 35 life-rating to keep it uniform)
-Made all provinces in the region of Savoy (which is shared by Burgundy and Savoy) have 35 life-rating (yet again making life-ratings uniform and removing the unnecessary vanilla nerfs that were kept by DoD)


A good bit of DoD's American, be it North or South, provinces were less than 35 life-rating (the default on most provinces), a lot of them even being below 30 life-rating (when you get population to actually grow). I have changed them all to be at least 37 life-rating, you should see a TREMENDOUS boost in natural population growth in the Americas, and a drastic increase in relevance in provinces with great RGOs that had shit life-rating (looking at you Qingqu, Incas).
Including Austrialia/New Zealand in the life-rating changes is part of my attempt to add Zhourao as an Immigrant nation, a nation you can actually play and might have an impact in the world.

The German/Burgundian changes are massive, Burgundy inherited a lot of bad life-rating provinces it had no business getting from Vanilla/HFM, and German high-liferating now properly includes the Austrians and the Swiss. I did however, keep this massive buff away from Bohemia, as I had explained before, as I feel their position in the world stage is too strong, and they are either incredibly powerful or immediately partitioned.
